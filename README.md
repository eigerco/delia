> [!WARNING]
> This project is under active development!

The Delia project is a complement to the [Polka Storage](https://github.com/eigerco/polka-storage) project,
being the frontend for file upload to the network's providers.

## Getting Started

### Polkadot Extension

Delia will require you to use the [Polkadot.js browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).
For instructions on how to add your own account, refer to the extension documentation:

* https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/usage
* https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/

### Preparing a storage deal

1. Start by selecting an account from the *Client Account* field.

   it will come in handy to retrieve your files!

in the "Deal Retrieval" page and press "Continue".
