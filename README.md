# Delia

> [!WARN]
> This project is under active development!

The Delia project is a complement to the [Polka Storage](https://github.com/eigerco/polka-storage) project,
being the frontend for file upload to the network's providers.

## Getting Started

The stack aims to be straightforward and opinionated,
using Typescript, Vite and Biome as the major development tools
and React & Tailwind for the frontend due to their ubiquity.

> [!WARN]
> Delia requires `pnpm`!

Install the project with:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Run the development setup with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Format and lint with:
```bash
pnpm run fmt && pnpm run lint
```
